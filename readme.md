# **Process Management Project**

Welcome to the **Process Management Project**! This tool provides a detailed overview of the processes running on your system. With this project, you can analyze and monitor active processes, including their CPU usage, memory consumption, start time, and status, in a user-friendly manner.

---

## **Key Features**

- üìä **View Active Processes**: Display detailed information about each process, including:
  - Process ID (PID)
  - Process name
  - CPU usage percentage
  - Memory usage
  - User associated with the process
  - Process status (e.g., running, sleeping)
  - Start time in a human-readable format

- üîÑ **Dynamic Updates**: Continuously fetch and display real-time process information.

- üêç **Python-based Implementation**: Built using Python with the `psutil` library to ensure compatibility across multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

- üñ•Ô∏è **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems.

## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

### **Prerequisites**

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or newer
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- `virtualenv` Python package (optional but recommended)

### **Installation Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Project**

   Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**

   Once you're done, deactivate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

## **How It Works**

The project consists of two main components:

1. **ProcessManager Class**:
   - Uses the `psutil` library to fetch system processes.
   - Collects information such as CPU usage, memory usage, process start time, and status.
   - Handles exceptions for processes that are inaccessible (e.g., due to permissions or system restrictions).

2. **Main Script**:
   - Initializes the `ProcessManager` class.
   - Retrieves and displays the list of active processes in a user-friendly format.
   - Ensures that the output is dynamic and informative.

## **Example Output**

When you run the project, you will see a detailed list of processes similar to this:

```plaintext
Active Processes:
------------------------------------------------------------
PID: 1234 | Name: python.exe | CPU: 10.2% | Memory: 5.3% | 
User: admin | Status: running | Start Time: 2024-11-28 12:34:56
PID: 5678 | Name: chrome.exe | CPU: 25.7% | Memory: 15.2% | 
User: admin | Status: sleeping | Start Time: 2024-11-27 09:21:45
...
------------------------------------------------------------
```

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- **Error: `psutil` not found**:
  Ensure you‚Äôve installed all dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  
- **Error: `AttributeError: module 'datetime' has no attribute 'fromtimestamp'`**:
  Make sure you‚Äôre importing the `datetime` module correctly (`from datetime import datetime`).

- **Permission Denied Errors**:
  Some processes may be restricted by the operating system. This is normal and does not affect overall functionality.

- **Python Not Found**:
  Ensure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH.

---

## **Additional Notes**

- **Platform-Specific Differences**: 
  - On Linux and macOS, the project has direct access to most system processes.
  - On Windows, administrative privileges might be required for full process visibility.

- **Extending the Project**:
  You can enhance the project to:
  - Add filtering options (e.g., show only processes using >10% CPU).
  - Export process data to a file (e.g., CSV or JSON).
  - Implement process monitoring alerts.
